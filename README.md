# Elara

Elara is a flexible and powerful database service library inspired by modern API services like Supabase. The goal of this project is to provide a general-use library that can be integrated into any system, offering robust functionality for interacting with databases in a seamless and intuitive way.

Currently, **Elara** is in its early stages of development, and this repository doesn't contain any code yet. However, we aim to provide features such as:

- Simplified table data retrieval with wide parameters (e.g., table name, columns, filter clauses, order, and pagination)
- Easy-to-use methods for inserting, updating, and deleting records
- RESTful API integration to interact with the service
- Java version utilizing string manipulations for database operations

## Features to be developed:
- Query building for retrieving table data
- Support for multiple databases
- Integration with other services, such as Serena (our API client library) for seamless API interaction

## Inspiration
Elara is inspired by Supabase and other modern database services that prioritize ease of use and flexibility. We aim to take those concepts and create a library that can be extended to fit various use cases.
